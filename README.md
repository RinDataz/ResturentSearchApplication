**2.	Outline:**

**Purpose of the Project:**
The purpose of this project is to create a web application that integrates both SQL and NoSQL databases to handle user authentication and restaurant data search functionality. The project aims to provide a practical understanding of database integration, server-side programming, and front-end development.

**Project Overview:**
This project involves the development of a web-based application with two main functionalities:
1.	User login and registration using an SQL database.
2.	Restaurant search functionality using a MongoDB database. Users can search for restaurants based on several criteria such as street, borough, cuisine, grade, and name.


**3.	Steps to Implement the Project:**

**Step 1: Database Setup**
SQL Database:
•	Create a database named users.db.
•	Create a table users with columns id, username, and password.
•	Insert initial user data into the users table.
MongoDB:
•	Create a database named restaurants.
•	Create a collection restaurants and import data from a JSON file.

**Step 2: Server-Side Implementation**
•	Set up a Flask server with necessary configurations.
•	Connect to the SQL and MongoDB databases.
•	Implement routes for login, registration, and restaurant search.

**Step 3: Frontend Implementation**
•	Create login.html for user login and registration.
•	Create search.html for restaurant search.


**4.	What You Learned from This Project**

•	Database Integration: How to integrate SQL and NoSQL databases into a single application.
•	Server-Side Programming: Handling routes and database connections.
•	Frontend Development: Creating and handling HTML forms 


**5.	Obstacles Faced During the Project**

•	Database Connection Issues: Initial difficulties connecting to both SQL and MongoDB.
•	Form Validation: Ensuring proper validation for login and registration forms.
•	Cross-Origin Requests: Handling CORS issues during frontend-backend communication.

**6.	Resources Used During Implementation**

•	Online Tutorials:
•	W3Schools for HTML and CSS
•	MDN Web Docs for JavaScript


**7.	Team Rules:**

•	Communication: Daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and obstacles.
•	Collaboration: Use of GitHub for version control and code review.
•	Responsibility: Clear division of tasks among team members.
•	Deadlines: Strict adherence to the project timeline to ensure timely completion.
